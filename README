================

DEPENDENCIES
------------

* CGAL 4.4
* VTK 5.8
* CMake
* Google Protobuf

INSTALLATION
------------

Recommended installation is to create an out-of-source build directory and to call CMake from there. A sample script for doing this is included in the GSSF package (../gssf/third-party/CGAL-4.3/run-cmake.sh). You should then run 'make' and 'make install'.

Running 'mesher_cgal --help' will provide a list of command line flags. For convenience, you may provide these in a Protobuf binary instead (see cgalsettings.proto for the definition of the format) and use the tool 'mesher_cgal.pb'.

Note that linking directly against this binary is prohibited by the GPL, except by GPL-compatibly licensed software.
